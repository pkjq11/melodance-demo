# Abstract

This paper focuses on music-driven dance motion generation, where current methods in this field often face challenges such as irregular dance movements and the inability to capture the relationship between music and dance emotions. To address these issues, The Musical Structure Feature Analysis (MSFA) module is introduced on the basis that taking into account the global structural features of songs can enhance the consistency of dance movement. The Emotion Alignment Module for Audio-Dance (EAM-AD) is designed to ensure that movement emotions match song emotions.  Additionally, a new Dance Sequence Generation Pipeline is proposed by extracting song emotional info, analyzing song structure, and using the dance generation module. Through experimental comparisons, the proposed approach outperforms previous methods, generating more harmonious dance movements.
